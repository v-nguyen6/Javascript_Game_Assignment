/*      javascript game

    basics: 
        - character on the bottom, controlled by left and right directional keys
        - enemies that are going from the top of the screen to the bottom
            - when enemies run into the user, the game is over (show "game over" screen)

    - goal:   
            - avoid enemies and collect coins
            - last as long as you can (like flappy bird?)

    - have a timer function
            - speed of enemies falling becomes faster with time

    - user interactions:
        - collect coins that are also falling ==> counts how many coins you run into?
        - avoid objects with directional keys
        - have the game end when it runs into the enemy
