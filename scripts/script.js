/*      javascript game - basically dino frogger lol

    basics: 
        - user's dinosaur on the bottom, controlled by left and right directional keys
        - enemies (i.e. meteors) that are going from the top of the screen to the bottom
                => when enemies run into user, show "game over" screen
        - have a timer function
                => speed of enemies falling becomes faster with time


    goal:   
        - avoid enemies and collect meat
        - last as long as you can (like flappy bird?)

    user interactions:
        - avoid enemies with directional keys
        - have the game end when dinosaur is in contact with the meteor

        - collect meat that are also falling 
                => counts how much meat you run into?

    game progression
        - [game start]
            - "press enter to continue"

        - [character selection screen]
            - "left and right to select a character, press enter to select"

        - [game begins]
            - meteors immediately begins falling (starts off slow)
            - meat begins falling (user can collect for points)

        - [game over]
            - only when user runs into the meteor
            - shows "game over"
                - shows your stats => (1) how long survived and (2) how many points collected

    *********questions to ask michael lol:
        - does the game need to be playable on mobile?
        - how to reset the game after [game over]?
