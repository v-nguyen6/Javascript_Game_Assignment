/*      javascript game - basically frogger lol

    basics: 
        - character on the bottom, controlled by left and right directional keys
        - enemies that are going from the top of the screen to the bottom
                => when enemies run into user, show "game over" screen
        - have a timer function
                => speed of enemies falling becomes faster with time

    goal:   
        - avoid enemies and collect coins
        - last as long as you can (like flappy bird?)

    user interactions:
        - collect coins that are also falling 
                => counts how many coins you run into?
        - avoid objects with directional keys
        - have the game end when it runs into the enemy
